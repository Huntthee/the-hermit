# The Hermit: A Text Based Adventure Game

## For the Love of Gaming and Code!
### The idea for this game comes from my childhood love of the online text adventure game 'The Legend Of The Green Dragon'

I intend to create this game as an exercise in JavaScript, SCSS and basic HTML to expand my capabilities as a developer and have some fun creating what will be my very first game!

Some extra inspiration came from watching the "High Score" series on Netflix about the revolution of the gaming industry in the late 80's and early 90's. 

Currently everything is still being drawn out on paper and visualized before the fingers hit the keyboard. But once I begin, feel free to pitch in or point out anything that could be done better, or that I may have done wrong!

| Phases | To Do: |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| * Imaginative Creation Phase | draw it all out, basic sentences, encounters etc.
| Basic Layouts | images, text box placement, links etc. |
| Pathing | test that links lead to new areas/encounters. |
| Lots More! | Likely to be many hurdles and unseen obstacles!|

**Current Ideas**

- Allow all links/buttons to be keyboard accessible with shortcut commands linked to each.

- Player starts in the dark, with a bag that contains a flashlight, some rope and a compass.

- Flashlight will allow player to find items in the dark forest.

- Movement available in the cardinal directions once the player has discovered the compass in their bag.

- Rope can be used to overcome obstacles like cliffs and create a few items like a simple tool/defense perhaps, once player has looked around and found a stick and rocks (maybe create spear?). 

- Create encounters that will be selected and presented at random to the player when they move in a direction.

- The player will eventually discover 'The Hermit' who can help with items, resting, food, and preparing to leave the forest.

- Once the player has found The Hermit, they can return to his home whenever needed.
